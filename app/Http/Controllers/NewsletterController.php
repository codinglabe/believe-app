SMS PLAIN TEXT (strict length):
- The "content" field MUST be at most {$n} characters total (count spaces and line breaks; use mb-safe length mentally). This is the entire SMS body subscribers see (aside from the subject line sent above it in the app).
- Write one tight message: usually one or two short sentences, or one sentence plus a line with {unsubscribe_link} if it still fits within {$n} characters. No long newsletters.
- Put the key idea in the first sentence. Merge tokens like {unsubscribe_link} count toward the limit in the final editor—keep the draft short enough that expanded URLs still work for your use case.
- Subject: keep it short and punchy (aim under 72 characters); it appears above the body in the SMS preview.

PROFESSIONAL PLAIN-TEXT COPY (not tiny, not shallow):
- Write like a senior nonprofit communications lead: warm, confident, clear, donor-appropriate. No filler, no robotic stock phrases.
- Structure: optional short kicker line; a strong headline line; 3–7 paragraphs separated by double \n; optional short bullet lines using "• " or "- "; a clear call-to-action; closing line; footer with Unsubscribe using exactly {unsubscribe_link} (and {public_view_link} only where a browser link makes sense).
- Length: unless the user brief is intentionally very short, aim for roughly 180–500 words for newsletters and substantive announcements—never a single cramped paragraph or a list of tiny one-line fragments only.
- Spacing: use double line breaks between sections so the text breathes; avoid walls of dense micro-sentences.
- Voice: varied sentence length; concrete details from the brief; professional vocabulary without being stiff.

Professional (subject, headings, body copy):
- Voice: senior nonprofit communications director — credible, structured, calm authority. Short opening line stating purpose; then evidence (impact, numbers, program facts) in clear paragraphs.
- Diction: precise, inclusive, donor-appropriate. Prefer active verbs. Avoid slang, emoji, and strings of exclamation marks.
- Structure: logical flow (context → update → ask). One primary CTA; secondary links only if the brief requires.
- Subject lines: confident and specific (not clickbait); under ~90 characters when possible.
TCOPY,
            'warm' => <<<'TCOPY'
Warm (subject, headings, body copy):
- Voice: friendly community builder — grateful, human, conversational without being sloppy. Use "we" and "you" naturally; thank readers genuinely.
- Diction: plain language, short paragraphs, occasional gentle rhetorical question. Light warmth, not saccharine.
- Structure: story-first when the brief allows (one human-scale example), then clear next step. Sign off with appreciation.
- Subject lines: inviting and personal; may include {organization_name}; avoid ALL CAPS.
TCOPY,
            'urgent' => <<<'TCOPY'
Urgent (subject, headings, body copy):
- Voice: timely and direct — respect readers' time. Lead with the deadline or consequence in the first sentence; no filler.
- Diction: strong verbs; short sentences in the opening; still respectful (never manipulative or guilt-tripping). One clear "what to do now."
- Structure: urgency block → why it matters (brief) → single decisive CTA → reassurance (tax status, link to learn more) if relevant.
- Subject lines: deadline or outcome in first half; honest urgency without spam clichés.
TCOPY,
            'celebratory' => <<<'TCOPY'
Celebratory (subject, headings, body copy):
- Voice: joyful milestone energy — proud of community and impact. Energetic but professional; toast the win, then invite continued partnership.
- Diction: vivid, upbeat word choice; short celebratory headline; optional bullet list of wins. Use exclamation points sparingly (at most one in the hero line).
- Structure: celebrate → share proof or quotes → thank supporters → CTA (give, join, share). Avoid sounding flippant about serious missions.
- Subject lines: festive and specific (what we achieved together); still readable in the inbox.

            'professional' => <<<'THtml'
HTML visual personality (professional):
- Aim for "annual report / trusted institution": deep navy or charcoal header band, generous white or off-white content panels with clear padding (24–32px) and a rounded outer card (border-radius 8–12px) around the main article, one strong blue or teal CTA, hairline dividers, restrained shadow on the primary button.
- On white/off-white article panels: all paragraph copy must be explicit dark slate (#0f172a / #334155). Never apply light/white text to those cells.
- Optional: ONE narrow two-column table row ONLY for compact metrics (e.g. "Donors | 1,240") — never for long paragraphs or the main story.
- Footer: dark band with muted links; keep hierarchy obvious (H1 → section → CTA → footer).
THtml,
            'warm' => <<<'THtml'
HTML visual personality (warm):
- Aim for "community coffee chat": cream or soft peach tints, rounded corners on cards (border-radius 8–12px), terracotta or amber accent, soft borders (#e7e5e4 / warm gray).
- NEVER output only white + terracotta button + terracotta footer: add a dark espresso/navy/chocolate TOP band (full width) for org line or issue kicker, then the cream article card — otherwise it looks like a draft.
- On cream/peach panels, body text MUST be dark espresso or brown (#422006, #78350f, #1c1917) — never white or cream-colored text on cream backgrounds.
- Use a friendly subhead in a tinted callout box; CTA can be warm orange or deep amber (still WCAG contrast). Avoid cold blues as the only accent.
- First line of the message body in the card should be a clear headline (<h1> or styled title), not the same font/size as body paragraphs.
- Imagery: omit or use neutral decorative bands only—no broken img URLs.
THtml,
            'urgent' => <<<'THtml'
HTML visual personality (urgent):
- Aim for "deadline / action alert": high-contrast hero strip (near-black or deep red-brown) with white headline; thin alert bar or left border accent in red or safety orange.
- Below the hero, the explanatory body usually sits on white or #fef2f2 — there you MUST use dark text (#171717, #404040, #0f172a), never white.
- CTA must be impossible to miss (large, solid fill); optional countdown-style typography for the deadline line (plain text, not scripts).
- Keep body readable: alternate white and very light gray rows; do not reduce font size below 15px for main copy.
THtml,
            'celebratory' => <<<'THtml'
HTML visual personality (celebratory):
- Aim for "gala program / milestone card": rich plum, magenta, or royal purple bands; gold or champagne accent for dividers or eyebrow text; confetti-like spacing via generous padding (no image assets required).
- Hero: bold headline on saturated mid-tone background with white text; follow with airy white or lilac-tint section for story — story text MUST be dark (#1e1b4b, #4c1d95, #0f172a), never white on pale lilac/white.
- CTA: rounded, festive color (fuchsia or gold on deep background) but still readable. Footer can echo the hero color in a slimmer band.

    /**
     * Shared HTML email design instructions for AI (inline CSS, dark + light, varied palettes — not flat all-white).
     */
    private function newsletterAiHtmlDesignInstructions(string $tone): string
    {
        $base = <<<AIHTML
EMAIL HTML DESIGN — premium, highly stylized, email-client safe:
Goal: every email must look like a designed product from a top nonprofit or brand—bold color harmony, clear hierarchy, deliberate UI. Forbidden: a flat “black text on plain white only” layout with no colored structure. Forbidden: washed-out gray-only design with no strong accent.

DARK / LIGHT & PALETTE VARIETY (mandatory):
- Include at least ONE prominent dark or rich band: e.g. header strip, hero block, mid-body feature strip, or footer with background #0f172a, #18181b, #1e1b4b, #14532d, #7f1d1d, #4c1d95, or similar deep tone, with light text (#f8fafc–#ffffff) OR high-contrast inverse. Light content areas are fine, but the design must not be “all light / all white canvas only.”
- Typical winning structure: dark outer wrapper OR dark top banner row → then a full-width LIGHT content row (#ffffff / #f8fafc) for the main story with dark text — so readers never read paragraphs on the same dark purple as the “You’re invited” strip.
- Pick ONE cohesive palette per email with 4–6 intentional colors: deep neutral + surface + saturated accent + muted secondary text + hairline borders. Rotate feel by tone: e.g. midnight + electric blue + cloud white; forest + antique gold + ivory; wine + blush + charcoal; slate + emerald CTA + cream panel—not the same blue-on-white every time.
- Ensure WCAG-ish contrast: body text on backgrounds must stay readable (no light gray #cbd5e1 on white for main copy).

CRITICAL — READABILITY (main story / light panels) — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- Light backgrounds include: #ffffff, #fffbeb, #fff7ed, #fefce8, #f8fafc, #f1f5f9, #faf5ff, #fefefe, #fffcf5, cream, ivory, or any background lighter than ~#e2e8f0. On ALL of these, paragraph and list text MUST use DARK colors only, e.g. color:#0f172a; or color:#1e293b; or color:#334155; or color:#422006; (warm) — minimum contrast like black/dark gray on paper.
- Never use pale gray, silver, or “muted” text colors (#e5e7eb, #cbd5e1, #94a3b8, #9ca3af) for body copy on white/cream — they look invisible; use #0f172a–#334155 only. Match text color to the panel: light panel = dark text; dark header/footer = light text.
- NEVER put color:#ffffff; color:#fff; color:#f8fafc; color:#e2e8f0; color:#cbd5e1; or similar light/near-white text on a light/cream/white panel — this is a common bug and is FORBIDDEN.
- White or near-white text is ONLY allowed inside genuinely DARK bands (header/footer/hero blocks with background roughly #0f172a, #18181b, #1e1b4b, #422006, #4c1d95, #7f1d1d, or similar dark hex). If you nest a light inner card inside a dark section, that inner card must switch back to dark text on light background.
- Every <p>, <li>, and main body <td> on a light background must set an explicit dark color in its style= attribute (do not assume inheritance from a wrapper).
- Links on light backgrounds: use color:#1d4ed8; or color:#0369a1; and underline — not white.

CRITICAL — DARK BACKGROUNDS (purple header, navy, charcoal strips) — NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- “Dark” includes: #0f172a, #18181b, #1e1b4b, #312e81, #4c1d95, #581c87, #5b21b6, saturated purple/magenta hero bars, deep plum, navy, #171717, or any background roughly darker than #475569.
- On ANY dark background, paragraph/list text MUST be LIGHT: color:#f8fafc; color:#ffffff; or color:#e5e7eb; — NEVER dark slate (#334155, #1e293b, #0f172a, #475569, #64748b) on dark purple/navy — that combination is unreadable.
- FORBIDDEN: placing the main invitation/body paragraphs in the same full-width dark cell as a headline band while still using dark gray “body” colors — that yields invisible text.

STRUCTURE — MAIN STORY MUST BE READABLE (pick one pattern and stick to it):
- Preferred: After a colored title/hero row, use a NEW table row whose cell has background:#ffffff; or #f8fafc; or #fffbeb; padding:24px 28px; and put ALL multi-paragraph event details there with explicit dark text colors (as in the light-panel rules above).
- Alternative: an all-dark email body — then every line of story text on dark bg must use light-colored inline styles on each <p> and <li>.
- Never leave long body copy in a dark purple/navy area with inherited or default dark-gray paragraph colors.

PROFESSIONAL LAYOUT (raise quality):
- Main content area: generous padding (24–32px) on the primary text cell; clear separation between header band, article body, and footer.
- Prefer a single centered “card” feel for the article: optional subtle border 1px solid #e2e8f0 or very soft shadow on the main white/cream block.
- Use consistent vertical rhythm: margin between paragraphs (e.g. 0 0 16px 0), one clear H1-style headline for the message, optional subhead in slightly muted dark (#475569) on light backgrounds only.

PADDING, ROUNDED CORNERS & BREATHING ROOM (MANDATORY — not optional “nice to have”):
- Do NOT output flat, edge-to-edge text blocks that touch the 600px gutters. Inner content MUST have horizontal inset: use at least padding:24px 28px on story cells (28px–36px is better for the main card).
- The main light “article card” <td> MUST look designed: combine border-radius:12px–16px; overflow:hidden; with background #ffffff or #f8fafc, plus either border:1px solid #e2e8f0; and/or box-shadow:0 10px 40px rgba(15,23,42,0.06); so the body feels like a rounded card, not a raw rectangle.
- Hero/header bands: use padding:20px 28px minimum on those cells so headlines never hug the viewport edge; rounded top corners (border-radius:12px 12px 0 0) on the hero row pair well with a rounded card row below.
- Between major sections, add clear separation: extra padding-bottom on the section cell (e.g. 20px–28px) OR a spacer row (<tr><td style="height:16px;font-size:0;line-height:0;">&nbsp;</td></tr>) — sections must not look glued together.
- Quote / highlight / event-detail sub-panels: inner padding 16px–22px; border-radius:8px–12px; subtle border or left accent border as already described.
- CTA area: wrap the button in a <td> with padding:16px 24px 24px; button uses border-radius:9999px or 10px–12px (pill look), not a sharp square.
- Footer band: padding:20px 28px; maintain rounded bottom corners (border-radius:0 0 12px 12px) if it sits under a rounded card stack for one cohesive “device” silhouette.

BODY LAYOUT — SINGLE READABLE COLUMN (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- The greeting ("Dear {recipient_name},") and ALL narrative paragraphs MUST sit in ONE full-width vertical column inside the ~600px content area — like a real marketing email from Mailchimp or Constant Contact.
- FORBIDDEN: CSS multi-column layouts (never use column-count, columns:, or multi-column in style=). FORBIDDEN: newspaper-style narrow strips of text. FORBIDDEN: one table row with many side-by-side <td> cells each holding a slice of the same article (that produces unreadable 5–6 column disasters).
- FORBIDDEN: splitting the main story across more than one horizontal cell. The main article uses a single <td width="100%" style="..."> (or one inner table with one content column) for all body <p> tags in reading order.
- OK: optional side-by-side cells ONLY for short label/value pairs, stats digits, or a two-button row — not for the primary letter copy.

PROFESSIONAL EMAIL = TABLE-BASED “2003 WEB” (industry standard — same as Mailchimp / Campaign Monitor docs):
- Email clients (especially Outlook) do NOT reliably support CSS Grid, Flexbox for layout, or float-based columns. Your layout MUST be nested <table role="presentation"> with cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0".
- FORBIDDEN in html_content for structure: display:flex; display:grid; float:left/right for the main story; <div> “columns” that simulate a newspaper. If you need two pieces of info side by side, use ONE <tr> with exactly two <td width="50%"> ONLY for short label/value or icons — never for flowing article paragraphs.
- Center the canvas: outer wrapper <table width="100%"><tr><td align="center"> then inner <table width="600" style="max-width:600px;width:100%;"> … </table></td></tr></table>.
- Build the letter as VERTICAL STACK of full-width rows: each narrative block is <tr><td width="600" style="padding:…"> … </td></tr> with only ONE <td> in that row. Put every greeting + body <p> inside that same full-width cell (or stack multiple <tr> each with a single <td> — still one column).

CANONICAL SHAPE (your HTML must follow this stacking idea — adapt colors/sections to the brief):
1) [Optional] One row: thin accent bar (full width inside 600px table).
2) One row: hero/header band — single <td width="600">, dark bg, light text, headline only (short).
3) One row: MAIN ARTICLE — single <td width="600" style="background:#ffffff;padding:28px 32px;border-radius:12px;overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #e2e8f0;box-shadow:0 10px 40px rgba(15,23,42,0.07);"> containing ONLY: greeting line + all <p> paragraphs + lists + CTA button row + closing. All body text color:#0f172a or similar DARK on white. (Adapt padding/radius to tone but keep the card-like finish.)
4) Optional rows: quote box, event details mini-table (label | value), secondary CTA — each as its own <tr><td> full width.
5) One row: footer band — single <td>, often dark bg, small light gray links.

HEADER / HERO TEXT ON DARK BANDS:
- Any headline, title, or eyebrow line sitting on a dark or saturated background (#1e1b4b, #4c1d95, #5b21b6, #0f172a, navy, charcoal, etc.) MUST set inline text color to light: e.g. style="color:#ffffff;" or color:#f8fafc; on that element (and on nested <span> if used). Never rely on browser default black/dark gray on purple — that is unreadable.

Technical rules (must follow):
- Use ONLY inline CSS (style attributes on elements). No <style> blocks, no external stylesheets, no @import, no <script>, no web fonts from URLs.
- Quoting: use double quotes for style= attributes whenever the CSS value contains single-quoted font names, e.g. style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif; ..." — never break HTML with mismatched quotes.
- Layout: outer wrapper table role="presentation" width="100%"; inner main column width="600" (HTML attribute) with style max-width:600px;width:100%; margin:0 auto; align="center" on wrapper where helpful. Stack sections as separate table rows with ONE content cell per row for the newsletter story — this is how production email HTML is written.
- Every <table> used for layout: role="presentation", border="0", cellpadding="0", cellspacing="0".

Reference palettes (adapt—do not copy blindly every time; vary with the brief and tone "{$tone}"):
  • Professional / trust: charcoal #0f172a, body #334155, accent #2563eb or #0369a1, soft panels #f1f5f9 / #eff6ff, white cards #ffffff, optional dark footer band #0f172a.
  • Warm / community: espresso #422006, body #78350f, accent #c2410c or #b45309, cream #fffbeb, peach tint #fff7ed.
  • Urgent / timely: near-black #171717, body #404040, accent #dc2626 or #ea580c, pale alert #fef2f2.
  • Celebratory: plum #5b21b6, accent #c026d3 or #db2777, gold #ca8a04, lilac panel #faf5ff.

Visual styling (apply several—not minimal):
- Thin colored top accent bar (4–6px) full width in primary accent.
- Eyebrow / kicker: small uppercase, letter-spaced, accent color (e.g. font-size:11px; letter-spacing:0.12em; font-weight:600).
- Main headline: 22–28px, extra-bold, strong contrast against its background.
- Alternate section backgrounds: white vs subtle tinted rows (#f8fafc, #f1f5f9, or 4–8% accent tint).
- Pull quote or highlight: left border 4px solid accent; tinted background; padding 16–20px.
- Primary CTA: inline-block; padding:14px 32px; strong accent background; color:#ffffff; border-radius:8px; font-weight:700; optional box-shadow:0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.12). href="#" or allowed merge tokens only.
- Dividers: 1px solid muted (#e2e8f0 or from palette).
- Footer: distinct band—often dark (#0f172a / #18181b) with muted text #94a3b8, {organization_name}, <a href="{unsubscribe_link}" style="color:#cbd5e1;">Unsubscribe</a>; optional <a href="{public_view_link}">View in browser</a>.

Typography (inline): font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; body 15–17px, line-height 1.65–1.7; headings clearly larger and colored—not browser defaults.

UNACCEPTABLE “DRAFT” LOOK (this exact failure pattern is FORBIDDEN):
- A gray outer area + one plain white content column + long body as a stack of same-weight <p> paragraphs + ONE centered accent button + matching accent footer — with NO dark/navy header band, NO real headline hierarchy, NO card shadow, NO eyebrow/kicker, NO mid-body divider or highlight strip. That reads as unfinished and is NOT professional enough for this product.
- If you use a warm terracotta/coral/orange accent for CTA + footer, you MUST still add: (1) a distinct dark or deep-colored TOP header row (org name / issue line) OR a saturated hero band above the article; (2) an <h1> or visually dominant title inside the article card (font-size 24–28px; font-weight:700; margin 0 0 12px 0) — the first line of the story must NOT be a plain <p> that looks identical to the rest; (3) at least one structural separator: horizontal rule row, “Impact at a glance” tinted strip, or left-border quote box between sections.
- The primary CTA button must sit in its own <tr><td> with padding-bottom AT LEAST 24px BEFORE the next paragraph (“Warm regards…” / closing). Never let the closing paragraphs butt against the button — that causes overlap/tight layout in clients.

MINIMAL / “3 ROW” LAYOUT IS FORBIDDEN — premium marketing email required:
- The output must NOT look like only: (1) thin header bar (2) one big plain text block (3) footer. That is unacceptable for this product.
- You MUST ship a polished layout comparable to top Mailchimp / nonprofit campaign templates: layered sections, clear hierarchy, obvious CTA, and visual “chrome” (borders, rounded panels, spacing).
- Mandatory elements (include ALL that apply to the brief):
  • A thin top accent stripe (4–6px) OR gradient-look via two adjacent table rows if needed.
  • A hero/title band (can be colored) with large headline + optional small eyebrow/kicker line above it (uppercase, letter-spaced).
  • A main content “card” on light bg with border-radius:10px–14px; padding:28px–36px; optional border:1px solid #e2e8f0; optional box-shadow:0 10px 40px rgba(15,23,42,0.08).
  • For events/invitations: a dedicated “Event details” sub-panel — use a nested table or bordered inner box with rows like Label | Value (bold label column, regular value), not a single wall of paragraphs.
  • At least ONE prominent primary CTA button (not a plain link): pill/rounded, padding 14–18px, strong fill color, white label text, centered or left-aligned in its own padded row.
  • Optional secondary text link row (“View in browser”, etc.) using {public_view_link} where appropriate.
  • A mid-body highlight strip OR quote box (left border + tinted bg) for one key sentence if it fits the brief.
  • Footer band with org context + unsubscribe — visually distinct from body (often dark).
- Spacing: never cram; use padding-bottom on sections (16–28px). Headline margin-bottom 8–12px; paragraph margin 0 0 14px 0.
- Visual interest: vary font sizes (eyebrow 11px, H1 24–30px, body 15–16px, small print 13px). Use at least two font-weight steps (600 vs 400).
- Length: html_content should be substantial HTML (multiple nested tables/rows reflecting sections), not a 10-line stub.

Images: omit <img> unless the brief asks; never broken URLs.

You help nonprofits write email templates. Respond with ONLY a single JSON object (no markdown fences).
Required keys: "subject" (string), "content" (string), "suggested_name" (string, 2-6 words, title case — this is the internal template name).

PLAIN TEXT OUTPUT ONLY for this request:
- Generate suggested_name, subject, and the full email body as plain text only in "content".
- Do NOT use HTML tags anywhere. Set "html_content" to exactly "" (empty string).

{$plainQuality}

MERGE VARIABLES — STRICT (non-negotiable):
- The ONLY strings that may appear inside single curly braces {…} anywhere in subject or body are exactly: {$mergeVars}
- There are NO other merge fields. Do NOT invent placeholders for stories, blurbs, CTAs, URLs, or “sections”. Forbidden examples (never output these): {impact_story}, {story}, {body}, {main_content}, {cta_link}, {donate_link}, {event_info}, {donor_name}, {first_name}, {date}, or any {word} except those listed above.
- If the brief asks for an impact story, example copy, or event details: write that text in full as normal sentences—no curly braces around it.
- Do NOT use {{name}}, %email%, [FIRST_NAME], or double curly braces. No spaces inside braces (use {organization_name} not { organization_name }).

Subject: compelling, under 200 characters; you may include {organization_name} where it fits.
content: must include the real unsubscribe merge token, e.g. a line "Unsubscribe: {unsubscribe_link}" using exactly {unsubscribe_link}.

You help nonprofits write email campaigns. Respond with ONLY a single JSON object (no markdown fences).
Required keys: "subject" (string), "content" (string).

PLAIN TEXT OUTPUT ONLY for this request:
- Generate subject and the full email body as plain text only in "content".
- Do NOT use HTML tags anywhere. Set "html_content" to exactly "" (empty string).

This is for a single newsletter send (not a reusable template). Do not include a template name field.

{$plainQuality}

MERGE VARIABLES — STRICT (non-negotiable):
- The ONLY strings that may appear inside single curly braces {…} anywhere in subject or body are exactly: {$mergeVars}
- There are NO other merge fields. Do NOT invent placeholders for stories, blurbs, CTAs, URLs, or “sections”. Forbidden examples (never output these): {impact_story}, {story}, {body}, {main_content}, {cta_link}, {donate_link}, {event_info}, {donor_name}, {first_name}, {date}, or any {word} except those listed above.
- If the brief asks for an impact story, example copy, or event details: write that text in full as normal sentences—no curly braces around it.
- Do NOT use {{name}}, %email%, [FIRST_NAME], or double curly braces. No spaces inside braces (use {organization_name} not { organization_name }).

Subject: compelling, under 200 characters; you may include {organization_name} where it fits.
content: must include {unsubscribe_link}; you may include {public_view_link} where a browser view link is appropriate.

DUAL OUTPUT — full professional plain text + HTML for one send:

{$plainQuality}

- "content": Full text/plain body: multi-paragraph, \\n\\n between sections, same narrative as the HTML—not a short SMS-only blurb. Typical length when the brief allows: ~150–500+ words. No HTML tags. Merge variables only: {$mergeVars}. Include {unsubscribe_link} and {public_view_link} where appropriate.
- "html_content": Full email-safe HTML implementing the design specification below.
